# Financial Database Query Templates

This document provides a comprehensive reference for query templates used in the financial database Text2SQL system. Each template maps natural language queries to SQL queries with parameterized values.

## Template Overview

The system includes templates for various financial data queries, ranging from basic company information to complex financial analysis. Templates are structured with:

- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Natural Language Template**: Human-readable query pattern with parameters
- **Key Parameters**: Required values to complete the query
- **Tables Used**: Database tables required for this query
- **SQL Template**: Corresponding SQL query structure
- **Sample Query**: Example of a fully parameterized query

## Basic Queries

### Company Information

| ID | Natural Language Template | Key Parameters | Tables Used |
|----|--------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| basic_company_info | Show me information about {company} | company | ciqcompany |

```sql
SELECT companyid, companyname, city, yearfounded, webpage
FROM ciqcompany
WHERE {company_condition}
```

**Sample Query:**
- Natural Language: "Show me information about Apple"
- SQL:
```sql
SELECT companyid, companyname, city, yearfounded, webpage
FROM ciqcompany
WHERE companyname LIKE '%Apple Inc.%'
```

### Geographic Analysis

| ID | Natural Language Template | Key Parameters | Tables Used |

LIMIT 25
```

**Sample Query:**

## Parameter Types

The templates use various parameter types that must be substituted with appropriate values:

| Parameter Type | Description | Examples | SQL Mapping Example |
|----------------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| company | Company name | Apple, Microsoft, Google | `companyname LIKE '%Apple Inc.%'` |
| country | Country name | United States, Japan, Germany | `g.country = 'Japan'` |
| comparison | Comparison operator | greater than, less than, equal to | `>`, `<`, `=` |
| year | Year value | 2020, 2015, 2010 | `2020` |
| count | Numeric count | 5, 10, 25 | `10` |
| industry | Industry category | Technology, Finance, Healthcare | `i.industryname LIKE '%Technology%'` |
| financial_metric | Financial measurement | market cap, revenue, P/E ratio | `m.marketcap`, `f.revenue` |
| amount | Monetary amount | $10 billion, $100 million | `10000000000`, `100000000` |
| relationship_type | Business relationship | subsidiary, parent company | `brt.childname = 'Subsidiary'` |
| region | Geographic region | Europe, Asia, North America | `g.region = 'Europe'` |
| time_condition | Time period | in the last 5 years, since 2018 | `>= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years'` |

## Usage Notes

1. Each template requires specific parameter values to generate valid SQL
2. SQL templates include placeholders that must be replaced with contextually appropriate values
3. Some parameters (like company_condition) require special handling to convert natural language to SQL conditions
4. Date-related queries use the most recent data available through subqueries
5. Financial values are typically converted to billions or millions for readability
6. Complex conditions may require handling multiple parameters simultaneously
7. Certain company names (like Google/Alphabet) may need special SQL conditions to handle alternative names
8. Recursive queries (like hierarchical relationships) require careful handling of termination conditions

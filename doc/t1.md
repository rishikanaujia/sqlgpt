## 1. üè¢ **Which companies are the most connected "Super Connectors" in the business network?**

**Business Value**: Identifies influential companies that could be key partners, acquisition targets, or market leaders.

```sql
-- Find companies with the most business relationships
WITH company_connections AS (
    SELECT companyid, COUNT(*) as total_connections
    FROM (
        SELECT parentcompanyid as companyid FROM ciqbusinessrel
        UNION ALL
        SELECT childcompanyid as companyid FROM ciqbusinessrel
    ) all_companies
    GROUP BY companyid
)
SELECT 
    companyid,
    total_connections,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_connections DESC) as connectivity_rank
FROM company_connections
ORDER BY total_connections DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## 2. üìä **What is the distribution of business relationship types, and which are most common?**

**Business Value**: Reveals the primary ways companies interact, helping understand market dynamics and common business models.

```sql
-- Analyze relationship type distribution with source reliability
SELECT 
    brt.parentname as relationship_type,
    brt.childname as reverse_relationship,
    COUNT(DISTINCT br.businessrelid) as relationship_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT br.parentcompanyid) as unique_parent_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT br.childcompanyid) as unique_child_companies,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT brs.businessrelsourcetypename, ', ') as data_sources
FROM ciqbusinessrel br
JOIN ciqbusinessreltype brt ON br.businessreltypeid = brt.businessreltypeid
JOIN ciqbusinessrelsourcetype brs ON br.businessrelsourcetypeid = brs.businessrelsourcetypeid
WHERE brt.currentflag = 1
GROUP BY brt.parentname, brt.childname, brt.businessreltypeid
ORDER BY relationship_count DESC;
```

## 3. üîç **How reliable is our relationship data based on source types?**

**Business Value**: Assesses data quality and identifies which relationships are most trustworthy for decision-making.

```sql
-- Data quality assessment by source
SELECT 
    brs.businessrelsourcetypename,
    COUNT(*) as total_relationships,
    COUNT(DISTINCT br.sourceidentifier) as unique_source_documents,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN br.sourceidentifier IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as documented_relationships,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN br.sourceidentifier IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as documentation_rate,
    COUNT(DISTINCT br.parentcompanyid) + COUNT(DISTINCT br.childcompanyid) as companies_covered
FROM ciqbusinessrel br
JOIN ciqbusinessrelsourcetype brs ON br.businessrelsourcetypeid = brs.businessrelsourcetypeid
GROUP BY brs.businessrelsourcetypename
ORDER BY total_relationships DESC;
```

## 4. ü§ù **Which companies have the most reciprocal (two-way) relationships?**

**Business Value**: Identifies strong partnerships and strategic alliances where both companies acknowledge the relationship.

```sql
-- Find reciprocal relationships (both companies acknowledge the relationship)
WITH reciprocal_pairs AS (
    SELECT 
        LEAST(br1.parentcompanyid, br1.childcompanyid) as company1,
        GREATEST(br1.parentcompanyid, br1.childcompanyid) as company2,
        br1.businessreltypeid,
        COUNT(*) as relationship_entries
    FROM ciqbusinessrel br1
    JOIN ciqbusinessrel br2 
        ON br1.parentcompanyid = br2.childcompanyid 
        AND br1.childcompanyid = br2.parentcompanyid
        AND br1.businessreltypeid = br2.businessreltypeid
    GROUP BY LEAST(br1.parentcompanyid, br1.childcompanyid), 
             GREATEST(br1.parentcompanyid, br1.childcompanyid),
             br1.businessreltypeid
)
SELECT 
    company1,
    company2,
    brt.parentname as relationship_type,
    relationship_entries
FROM reciprocal_pairs rp
JOIN ciqbusinessreltype brt ON rp.businessreltypeid = brt.businessreltypeid
WHERE brt.currentflag = 1
ORDER BY relationship_entries DESC, company1, company2
LIMIT 50;
```

## 5. üåê **What are the key supply chain and strategic partnership networks?**

**Business Value**: Maps critical business ecosystems, revealing supply chain dependencies and strategic alliance clusters.

```sql
-- Analyze strategic networks and supply chains
WITH relationship_categories AS (
    SELECT 
        br.*,
        CASE 
            WHEN brt.parentname IN ('Supplier', 'Vendor') THEN 'Supply Chain'
            WHEN brt.parentname IN ('Company') AND brt.childname = 'Strategic Alliance' THEN 'Strategic Partnership'
            WHEN brt.parentname IN ('Creditor', 'Investor Relations Firm') THEN 'Financial'
            WHEN brt.parentname IN ('Franchisor') THEN 'Franchise Network'
            ELSE 'Other'
        END as network_type
    FROM ciqbusinessrel br
    JOIN ciqbusinessreltype brt ON br.businessreltypeid = brt.businessreltypeid
    WHERE brt.currentflag = 1
)
SELECT 
    network_type,
    COUNT(DISTINCT businessrelid) as relationships,
    COUNT(DISTINCT parentcompanyid) as parent_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT childcompanyid) as child_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT parentcompanyid) + COUNT(DISTINCT childcompanyid) as total_companies_in_network
FROM relationship_categories
WHERE network_type IN ('Supply Chain', 'Strategic Partnership', 'Franchise Network')
GROUP BY network_type

UNION ALL

-- Find largest supply chain clusters
SELECT 
    'Largest Supply Chain Hub' as network_type,
    parentcompanyid as relationships,
    COUNT(DISTINCT childcompanyid) as parent_companies,
    0 as child_companies,
    COUNT(DISTINCT childcompanyid) + 1 as total_companies_in_network
FROM ciqbusinessrel br
JOIN ciqbusinessreltype brt ON br.businessreltypeid = brt.businessreltypeid
WHERE brt.currentflag = 1 
  AND brt.parentname IN ('Supplier', 'Vendor')

ORDER BY parent_companies DESC
LIMIT 5;
